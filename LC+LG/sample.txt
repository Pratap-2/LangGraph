LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-step agents. It allows developers to define structured workflows using graphs where nodes represent computation steps and edges define transitions.

LangChain is a broader framework for building applications with LLMs. It provides tools like prompt templates, memory, agents, retrievers, and more.

LangGraph can integrate with LangChain components, making it suitable for fine-grained control of multi-agent workflows or deterministic pipelines involving LLMs.
